## Survival in hand-reared African Penguins

This repository contains data and code for the case study in *Computationally efficient Bayesian capture-mark-recapture models with transients, applied to survival of hand-reared African Penguins*. We compare juvenile and adult survival between hand-reared and wild-raised African Penguins, estimated from mark-recapture data.

Scripts to run our analyses are in the folder `R` with Stan code in `stan`; READMEs in these folders contain further details.
